Micro-Frontend Architecture: Modular Blog Platform
Description:
—--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Assignment Topic: Micro-Frontend Architecture: Modular Blog Platform
Objective
Build a modular blog platform using a micro-frontend architecture. The platform should have at
least two independently developed modules: one for viewing blog posts and another for
managing (adding/editing) blog content. The modules should be able to function independently
and can be deployed separately but should still communicate with each other.
Example JSON Data Model
{
"posts": [
{
"postId": "bp1",
"title": "Introduction to Micro-Frontends",
"content": "Micro-frontends are a way to think about the web application
as a composition of features...",
"authorId": "u1",
"createdAt": "2023-10-05T14:00:00Z",
"updatedAt": "2023-10-05T16:00:00Z",
"tags": ["architecture", "frontend", "microservices"],
"status": "Published" // options: Draft, Published
},
{
"postId": "bp2",
"title": "Benefits of Modular Design",
"content": "Modular design in software development offers several key
advantages...",
"authorId": "u2",
"createdAt": "2023-09-20T10:00:00Z",
"updatedAt": "2023-09-21T08:30:00Z",
"tags": ["design patterns", "modular", "development"],
"status": "Draft"
}
],
"users": [
{
"userId": "u1",
"name": "Alice Johnson",
"email": "alice.johnson@example.com",
"role": "Editor"
},
{
"userId": "u2",
"name": "Bob Smith",
"email": "bob.smith@example.com",
"role": "Contributor"
}
]
}
Note: There is no need to define functionality for managing Users in the system. It is enough to
have a finite set of predefined users in the mock backend API. Yet, as specified in the
requirements, is should be possible to add, modify and delete blog posts.
Preferred technologies
Implement a solution using Angular (preferably), React or Vue.js. Implement the solution in
TypeScript. Simulate the simple backend RESTful APIs using some Mock/Fake server like
json-server.
Documentation
Write a short documentation about the concept of the solution, important decisions, and
pros/cons of the implemented solution.
